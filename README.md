# Sleep Disorder Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict sleep disorders based on various physiological and behavioral data inputs. The model is trained on a dataset containing features such as sleep patterns, lifestyle factors, and medical history, enabling the identification of individuals at risk for common sleep disorders.

The project aims to support early diagnosis and preventative healthcare by leveraging data-driven insights into sleep health, with applications in healthcare technology and wellness monitoring.
